# Budget Book 

So, Story Time. I spent around ₹6000 in a week, and I had no idea where it went. So I decided to track my budget from now on buttt turns out it's a hassle using the 'Notes' app, and other apps are not "automatic" enough.
So here comes the idea:

An Android app for budget management that works with Google Pay.

Basically, I wanted an app that will automatically open when I complete a transaction because it's a hassle to manually open a app and make and entry.
This app pops up an overlay bubble after a transaction, and all you have to do is enter name, quantity & price, and it will create a new entry.
