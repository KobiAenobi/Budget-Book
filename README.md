# Budget Book 

So, I spent around ₹6000 in a week, and I had no idea where it went. So I decided to track my budget from now on, BUT turns out it's a hassle using the 'Notes App', and other apps, as they are not "automatic" enough.
So here comes the idea:

An Android app for budget management that works with Google Pay.

Basically, I wanted an app that would automatically open when I complete a transaction because it's a hassle to manually open an app and make an entry.
This app pops up an overlay bubble after a transaction, and all you have to do is enter the item name, quantity & price, and it will create a new entry.



## Installation Instructions

Download the APK.
Install the app with the internet off because Google Play flags the app as Suspicious as it asks for Accessibility permissions./ Or Adb sideload if you can.

Go to settings and give the necessary permissions.

For the automatic overlay pop-up and notification on Google Pay transactions, you need to give Accessibility permission.

Log in for online cloud save.

⚠️ NOTE: On brands like Oppo, Realme, etc (the non-stock phones), the system tries to kill app Foreground services, so unrestricting battery optimization might help and do a quick reboot.
